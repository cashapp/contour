/**
 * [AxisSolver] represents a strategy for solving points on an axis.
 * Implementations of this interface should be as lazy as possible. Invokers of this interface
 * use the least-knowledge fields as possible. This helps solve certain types of layouts where axis dimension and
 * position need to be calculated separately.
 *
 * Calling into the [min], [mid], [baseline], [max], [range] methods will trigger other [AxisSolver]s in your
 * layout configuration if this Solver is not fully resolved.
 *
 * Pairs of scalar resolvers create a bounding box for a laid-out view. The [XAxisSolver] computes the
 * left and right edges, and the [YAxisSolver] computes the top and bottom edges.
 *
 * The [YAxisSolver] may also compute the baseline.
 *
 * Most applications shouldn't need to implement this type.
